## ✨ Features

### 🧠 **Prompt Brain**
**You are the architect.** Unlike black-box AI tools, eBoxAI lets you see and edit the exact prompts that drive the agent.
- *Tell it to be formal with clients.*
- *Tell it to be brief with internal updates.*
- *Tell it to ignore "limited time offers".*

### 🏷️ **Smart Categorization**
Forget manual sorting. The agent reads and tags every email instantly:
- **🔴 Important**: Urgent deadlines, boss requests, high-priority clients.
- **🔵 Newsletter**: Weekly digests, industry updates (kept out of your way).
- **🟡 To-Do**: Actionable items requiring your specific attention.
- **⚪ Spam**: Junk that slipped through the cracks.

### 📝 **Action Extraction & Auto-Drafting**
- **Action Items**: Automatically extracts tasks like *"Submit report by Friday"* or *"Call John at 2pm"*.
- **Draft Replies**: Pre-generates context-aware replies. You just review and hit send.

### 🛡️ **Security & Intelligence**
- **Dark Pattern Detector**: Warns you about manipulative emails (Fake Urgency, Scarcity).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Instantly see the emotional tone of emails (😊 😐 😤).
- **Smart Follow-Ups**: Tracks your commitments and what others owe you.

### 🗓️ **Meeting Prep Assistant**
- **Auto-Briefs**: Generates executive briefs for upcoming meetings.
- **Context Retrieval**: Summarizes past threads and suggests talking points.

### 💬 **Agent Chat (RAG-Lite)**
**Talk to your inbox.**
- *"What did my boss ask for last week?"*
- *"Do I have any pending invoices?"*
- *"Draft a polite decline to the webinar invitation."*

## 🚀 Getting Started

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 Prerequisites</strong></summary>

- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Python** (v3.9+)
- **Google Gemini API Key** (Optional, defaults to Mock Mode)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🐍 Backend Setup</strong></summary>

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Add your API Key
# Copy .env.example to .env and add GEMINI_API_KEY=...

uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚛️ Frontend Setup</strong></summary>

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🧠 Model Training & Data</strong></summary>

### Custom Model Training
We use a custom training pipeline to refine the agent's classification accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** approach for robust text classification.
- **Noise Injection**: Training includes adversarial examples, label flipping, and noise to ensure realistic performance (targeting ~92-96% accuracy).

```bash
# Train the model
python backend/training/train_model.py

# Evaluate performance
python backend/scripts/evaluate.py
```

### 🎲 Rich Data Seeding
For a fully populated demo environment (Kanban board, rich email examples):
```bash
python backend/scripts/seed_rich_data.py
```

## ☁️ Deployment Troubleshooting

### 1. Agent says "I am a mock agent"
This happens if the `GEMINI_API_KEY` is missing.
- **Vercel/Render**: Go to your project settings -> Environment Variables.
- Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your Google Gemini API key.
- Redeploy if necessary.

### 2. "Meetings" or "Follow-ups" tabs are empty
On platforms like Vercel/Render, the database starts empty. You need to seed it with demo data.
1. Deploy your backend.
2. Run the following command (replace with your backend URL):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/seed
   ```
   Or simply visit `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/docs`, find the `/seed` endpoint, and click "Try it out" -> "Execute".
3. Refresh your frontend. You should now see sample meetings and follow-ups.
